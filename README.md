# 📊 Marketing Performance Analytics — End-to-End SQL + Python + Power BI Project

## 📘 Project Overview

Marketing Performance Analytics is a complete end-to-end data analytics solution designed to analyze campaign effectiveness, optimize marketing spend, and improve return on investment (ROI).

This project demonstrates the full analytics lifecycle — from raw Excel/CSV ingestion into SQL Server, to data transformation using SQL & Python (EDA), and finally interactive business intelligence reporting using Power BI with advanced DAX measures.

The dashboard enables data-driven marketing decisions by analyzing:

Channel performance

Campaign profitability

Product-level revenue contribution

Regional performance trends

Conversion efficiency
